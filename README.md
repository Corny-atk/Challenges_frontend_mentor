## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsivity

### What I learned

I've learned how to center a block, import a font and, above all, create a page that corresponds as closely as possible to what's required.

### Continued development

Responsivity is a concept I'd like to perfect.
CSS Flexbox and CSS grid are also concepts to be reviewed.

### Useful resources

- [w3shools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This has helped me to review a number of concepts such as responsivity, CSS grid, etc. I really liked it and will use it going forward.
- [Mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This is an amazing site which helped me finally understand CSS flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
